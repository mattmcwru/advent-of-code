# Day 7 Solution

I started out this problem thinking I'd learn more about Zig structures by building a binary search tree.  This is the part1.zig file.  I ran out of time trying to figure out the allocation and init/deinit functions.  Loading into the binary tree seemed to work but I didn't finish the rest.

On the second go around, I realized that the Hand structure has most of what I was trying to learn anyway so I refactored it and used the MultiArrayList which I also wanted to learn more about, especially the sorting context functions.  Anyway, part1a.zig works and solved the problem.

Part 2 was a slight mod on the first part with a some additional cleanup.
