# Advent of Code â€” 2023

I decided to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org) while doing these problems so the code may be rough.

There are no build files so use the `zig run` command to run the code.

Some programs take the input data filename as a command-line argument, such as:

```zig run part1.zig -- data.txt```
